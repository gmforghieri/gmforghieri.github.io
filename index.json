Since then, I have lived in 4 countries, attended 3 educational institutions and worked in 4 companies in different roles. The experiences I have accumulated and books I\u0026rsquo;ve read made me realize, that the current educational system is flawed in many ways and has an abundance of inefficiencies.\nMy aspiration is to revolutionize our educational system, such that individuals are better equipped to tackle the challenges of present and future. I imagine an educational system which promotes the growth mindset, teaches individuals how to embrace hardships and welcome them as opportunities for self-improvement. An educational system which places great emphasis on making students understand how learning certain subject will benefit them as individuals on the long term.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"taxonomy","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"2525497d367e79493fd32b198b28f040","permalink":"https://gmforghieri.github.io/authors/admin/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/authors/admin/","section":"authors","summary":"Hi!
