      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hi! I&amp;rsquo;m Gian Marco. I am half italian half hungarian by origin and I grew up in a small town in Hungary.
I finished high school with many questions unanswered, therefore, I went on a journey of self-discovery, to see the world for myself,
figure out what I want from my life and explore what I am truly capable of.
Since then, I have lived in 4 countries, attended 3 educational institutions and worked in 4 companies in different roles.
The experiences I have accumulated and books I&amp;rsquo;ve read made me realize, that the current educational system is flawed in many ways and has an abundance of inefficiencies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My aspiration is to revolutionize our educational system, such that individuals are better equipped to tackle the challenges of present and future.
I imagine an educational system which promotes the growth mindset, teaches individuals how to embrace hardships and welcome them as opportunities for self-improvement.
An educational system which places great emphasis on making students understand how learning certain subject will benefit them as individuals on the long term.&lt;/p&gt;
