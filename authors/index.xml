      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hi! I&amp;rsquo;m Gian Marco. I am half italian half hungarian by origin and I grew up in a small town in Hungary.
I finished high school with many questions unanswered, therefore, I went on a journey of self-discovery, to see the world for myself,
figure out what I want from my life and explore what I am truly capable of.
Since then, I have lived in 4 countries, attended 3 higher educational institutions and worked in 4 companies in different roles.
The experiences I have accumulated and books I&amp;rsquo;ve read made me realize, that our society is flawed in many ways and has an abundance of inefficiencies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having said that, over the years I grew increasingly dissatisfied with the state of the educational system,
therefore I made it my personal vision to revolutionize our educational system,
such that individuals are better equipped to tackle the challenges of present and future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am currently studying computer science and refining my programming skills, as I firmly believe proficiency in this field is an absolute necessity for the future and to fulfill my vision.&lt;/p&gt;
