      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hi! I&amp;rsquo;m Gian Marco. I am a curious and rebellious individual constantly questioning the status quo and trying to find ways to better myself and make a positive impact in the world. I am a great believer in lifelong learning and self-development; for that reason, I wake up everyday with the intent to challenge myself, learn and expand my knowledge and limits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I finished high school with many questions unanswered, therefore, I went on a journey of self-discovery, to see the world for myself, figure out what I want from my life and explore what I am truly capable of. Since then, I have taken complete ownership of my life and finances, lived in 4 countries, attended 3 higher educational institutions and worked at 4 companies in different roles. The experiences I have accumulated and books I&amp;rsquo;ve read made me realize, that our society is flawed in many ways and has an abundance of inefficiencies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having said that, over the years I grew increasingly dissatisfied with the state of the educational system, consequently I made it my personal vision to revolutionize our educational system, such that individuals are better equipped to tackle the challenges of present and future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I realize that this journey is going to take a lifetime and I am just at the very beginning. In order to fulfill such a vision utilizing technology is essential and to build something revolutionary strong fundamentals are needed, thus I am currently studying computer science &amp;amp; engineering and refining my programming skills by working as a full stack software developer.&lt;/p&gt;
