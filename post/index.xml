      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this part I will write about the call to adventure which is about stepping out of the comfort zone,
leaving the ordinary world behind and facing the unknown.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As mentioned in the previous post, already in my last year of high school I was greatly dissatisfied and
felt that I am in a closed minded atmosphere which I needed to escape. Even though I did not really have an idea of where to continue,&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Hero&#39;s Journey - An Ordinary World</title>
      <link>https://gmforghieri.github.io/post/the-ordinary-world/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this series of blog posts I will attempt to analyze my journey based on the hero myth pattern popularized by Joseph Campbell,
which was influenced by Carl Jung&#39;s work on myth and archetypes also known as the ancient patterns of personality traits that are the shared heritage of the human race.
In other words, the hero&#39;s journey represents the universal human condition of being born into this world, growing, learning, struggling to become an individual, and dying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first part of the story in which we learn about the hero before the real journey begins.
The ordinary world describes the hero&#39;s comfort zone, customs, conditioned beliefs and behaviours.
This is where the hero lives before the journey, thus we learn about his everyday life and get a glimpse about his character.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on the above, I will attempt to describe how the ordinary world looked like for me and how certain events might have influenced
who I am today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coming Soon!&lt;/p&gt;
